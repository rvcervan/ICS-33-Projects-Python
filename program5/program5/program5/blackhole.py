# Black_Hole is derived from the Simulton: each updates by finding and removing
#   any Prey whose center is contained within its radius
#  (returning a set of all eaten simultons), and
#   displays as a black circle with a radius of 10
#   (width/height 20).
# Calling get_dimension for the width/height (for
#   containment and displaying) will facilitate
#   inheritance in Pulsator and Hunter
